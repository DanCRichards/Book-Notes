#### Doing the Unrealistic is Easier than Doing the Realistic. 
With a lot of society having self doubts of achieving amazing, world changing things. The competition of 'mediocre' ideas is intense. How many people do you see 'fail' on SharkTank? Heaps right? Well taking that into perspective, how many of those people were asking for $1Million in capital for their hairy, ballsy idea that is going to revolutionaise the _____ industry? - None that I am aware of. 
Having more self confidence can not only be benefitial for your success, it can actually make things a bit easier, you move ahead into the next tier of life where people don't see them selves. 

> It is easier to raise $1,000,000 than it is to raise $100,000
> Ninty-nine percent of people in the world are convinced they are incapable of achieving great things, so that aim for the mediocre.

#### What do you want? A better question, first of all
Firstly, my ideas on goals. I don't believe that people should have goals, but more 'pathways' where an end result is achieved but the general direction is known. You know where you want to go (Sure that's a goal) but your direction there isn't well known. 
Tim Ferriss talks about not looking at what makes you happy, but what excites you as an avenue to find your success.
